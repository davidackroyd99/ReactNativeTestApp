# ReactNativeTestApp
A smartphone app I built with React Native that gets some JSON and uses it to build a Netflix-inspired movie viewing app.

You can test it out by cloning the repo and using Expo to host the app. It has a sliding gallery to view all the movies and you can tap one to 'view the movie' (but not play it, obviously, it's just a little test).
